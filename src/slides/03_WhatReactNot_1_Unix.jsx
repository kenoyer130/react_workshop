# Side Tangent - Unix philosophy and React (Modern Javascript Stack)
*Side Tangents are Grumpy Old Man Kenoyer rants 
and may or may not have anything to do with React, Programming, or Common Sense.*

*Side Tangents are the personal views of Grumpy Old Man Kenoyer and not the official stance of ConnectWise Manage or trying to tell other BU what to do.*

* Compose your application of many small parts that talk to each other in a pipeline (NOT a monolithic app/framework)
* Each part should "Do one thing and do it well"
* Can switch out parts for better parts over time
* Each part is best in class at the one thing it does
