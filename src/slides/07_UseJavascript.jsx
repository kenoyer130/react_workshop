# Side Tangent (Rant?) - Use Javascript/Html/Css

* Yes Javascript is *The Suck* (ES 6 makes it much better!)
* Using JS will future proof your project
* History is littered with Frameworks "fixing" JavaScript
* JSX and SASS are examples of things close enough to the JS philosophy to count
* Typescript works along side JS so is fine also

## Small List
* Flash
* WebForms
* Silverlight
* CoffeeScript
* Adobe Air
* And many, many more
